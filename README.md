# Simple Posts App

This is a simple app where I tested API calls and navigation library called Auto Route.

## Demo
<p align="left">
  <img src="posts_page.png" height="450" />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <img src="users_page.png" height="450" />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>
<p align="left">
 <img src="user_info_page.png" height="450" />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
 <img src="dark_mode.png" height="450" />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>

## Functionality

### • Auto Route
It's a navigation package, it allows for strongly-typed arguments passing, effortless deep-linking and it uses code generation to simplify routes setup, with that being said it requires a minimal amount of code to generate everything needed for navigation inside of your App.

### • API Requests

Remote API requests with the help of free online REST API with fake posts and users. <br/><br/>
[JSONPlaceholder](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/) is a free online REST API that you can use whenever you need some fake data. It can be in a README on GitHub, for a demo on CodeSandbox, in code examples on Stack Overflow, ...or simply to test things locally.

### • Custom Light & Dark Theme
